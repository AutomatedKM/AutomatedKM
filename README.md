# FAQ for This Automated Account

This is an automated account run by [KohanMathers](https://kmathers.co.uk). The purpose is to remove artificial inflation of my personal account's contribution history by performing automated tasks that run frequently.

## Why does this account exist?
To keep my personal GitHub contribution graph honest, this account handles all the automated commits for my propjects. This separates automated activity from my actual coding work.

## What kind of tasks does this account perform?
Currently, it just updates a repository regularly with metadata about the songs I listen to, generating automated commits without manual coding input.

## Is this allowed by GitHub?
Yes, GitHub permits machine or automation accounts for tasks like this, as long as theyâ€™re not used to mislead about personal coding contributions.

## What happens if the automation breaks?
I monitor the system and will fix any issues promptly to ensure the commits continue smoothly.

## Why not just disable contributions for this project?
I really like my project, and bragging rights so...

## What's the meaning of life?
